# Ambient Audio Setup

Place your ambient audio file at:

```
frontend/public/wics_audio.mp3
```

The global ambient sound system expects a file named `wics_audio.mp3` in the `public` folder. Copy your wics_audio mp3 file from Downloads (or wherever it's stored) to this location.

- Sound is **off by default** — user must click the volume icon to enable
- Volume when enabled: 12%
- Smooth fade in (800ms) / fade out (500ms)
- Loops seamlessly
- No autoplay (browser audio policies respected)
