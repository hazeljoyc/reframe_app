# 🚀 WICS Hackathon Project: Reframe
## 🌟 Overview

This project is a web-based decision engine designed to help students and young professionals navigate education, internships, and career uncertainty.

Users can:
- Select a category (education, internships, career, etc.)
- Set their emotional state using an emoji slider
- Answer adaptive questions
- Receive a personalized action plan with:
  * A reframed perspective
  * 3 next actions
  * A short-term timeline

Our goal is to reduce the stress of feeling “behind.”

## 🧠 How It Works

1. User selects a category.
2. User sets emotional intensity.
3. User answers 3–4 adaptive questions.
4. Responses are sent to a Python backend.
5. AI generates:
* A reframe
* Explanation
* 3 next steps
* This week vs. this month timeline
